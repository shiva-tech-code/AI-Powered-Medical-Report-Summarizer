DEXA BONE DENSITY SCAN

CLINICAL HISTORY: 63-year-old postmenopausal female with family history of osteoporosis. Height: 5'4", Weight: 125 lbs.

TECHNIQUE: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan of the lumbar spine and bilateral hips.

FINDINGS:

LUMBAR SPINE (L1-L4):
- BMD: 0.820 g/cm²
- T-Score: -2.3 (Osteoporosis)
- Z-Score: -1.8
- Previous BMD (2 years ago): 0.850 g/cm²
- Change: -3.5% (significant bone loss)

LEFT HIP:
- Total Hip BMD: 0.720 g/cm²
- T-Score: -2.1 (Osteoporosis)
- Z-Score: -1.5
- Femoral Neck BMD: 0.650 g/cm²
- T-Score: -2.4 (Osteoporosis)

RIGHT HIP:
- Total Hip BMD: 0.715 g/cm²
- T-Score: -2.2 (Osteoporosis)
- Z-Score: -1.6
- Femoral Neck BMD: 0.645 g/cm²
- T-Score: -2.5 (Osteoporosis)

FOREARM (NON-DOMINANT):
- BMD: 0.580 g/cm²
- T-Score: -2.8 (Osteoporosis)
- Z-Score: -2.1

FRACTURE RISK ASSESSMENT:
- 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture: 18%
- 10-year probability of hip fracture: 6%

IMPRESSION:
1. Osteoporosis at the lumbar spine, both hips, and forearm
2. Significant bone loss since previous scan (3.5% decrease)
3. High fracture risk requiring treatment
4. Recommend bisphosphonate therapy (alendronate or zoledronic acid)
5. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation
6. Fall prevention counseling
7. Follow-up DEXA scan in 2 years
