CARDIAC STRESS TEST (EXERCISE TREADMILL)

CLINICAL HISTORY: 55-year-old male with chest pain and family history of coronary artery disease. Risk factors include hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

TECHNIQUE: Bruce protocol exercise treadmill test with continuous ECG monitoring and blood pressure measurements.

EXERCISE PROTOCOL:
- Stage 1: 1.7 mph, 10% grade - 3 minutes
- Stage 2: 2.5 mph, 12% grade - 3 minutes
- Stage 3: 3.4 mph, 14% grade - 3 minutes
- Stage 4: 4.2 mph, 16% grade - 3 minutes
- Total exercise time: 12 minutes
- Peak heart rate achieved: 165 bpm (95% of age-predicted maximum)

ECG FINDINGS:

RESTING ECG:
- Normal sinus rhythm
- Heart rate: 72 bpm
- No ST-T wave abnormalities
- No evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy

EXERCISE ECG:
- No significant ST-segment depression or elevation
- No arrhythmias during exercise
- Normal heart rate response to exercise
- No chest pain during exercise

BLOOD PRESSURE RESPONSE:
- Resting: 140/90 mmHg
- Peak exercise: 180/95 mmHg
- 3-minute recovery: 150/85 mmHg
- Blood pressure response: Normal

SYMPTOMS:
- No chest pain or discomfort
- No shortness of breath
- No dizziness or syncope
- Exercise tolerance: Good

IMPRESSION:
1. Negative exercise stress test
2. No evidence of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia
3. Normal heart rate and blood pressure response to exercise
4. Good exercise tolerance (12 minutes on Bruce protocol)
5. No significant ECG changes during exercise
6. Low probability of significant coronary artery disease
7. Continue current medical therapy for hypertension and hyperlipidemia
8. Recommend regular exercise program
9. Follow-up in 1 year or sooner if symptoms develop
