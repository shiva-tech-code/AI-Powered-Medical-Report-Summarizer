- No significant interval changes
- Stable breast density
- No new findings

BI-RADS ASSESSMENT:
- Category 1: Negative
- Recommendation: Routine screening mammography in 1 year

ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Due to heterogeneously dense breast tissue, consider supplemental screening with breast ultrasound or MRI
- Continue monthly breast self-examination
