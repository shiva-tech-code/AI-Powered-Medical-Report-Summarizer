PATIENT: Maria Garcia
DOB: 09/25/1972
DATE: 12/16/2023
MRN: 99887766

BRAIN MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST

CLINICAL HISTORY: 51-year-old female with headaches, dizziness, and memory difficulties. Patient reports progressive cognitive decline over 6 months.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, and post-contrast T1-weighted images obtained through the brain.

FINDINGS:

PARENCHYMA:
- No acute intracranial hemorrhage
- No evidence of acute infarction
- Mild generalized cerebral atrophy for age
- No focal mass lesions or enhancing lesions
- No evidence of demyelinating disease

WHITE MATTER:
- Scattered small foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes
- No evidence of acute white matter disease

VENTRICULAR SYSTEM:
- Mild enlargement of the lateral ventricles consistent with mild hydrocephalus ex vacuo
- No evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus
- Fourth ventricle normal in size and position

CEREBELLUM:
- Normal size and signal characteristics
- No focal lesions

BRAINSTEM:
- Normal appearance
- No focal lesions or signal abnormalities

SELLA TURCICA:
- Pituitary gland normal in size and signal characteristics
- No pituitary adenoma

CEREBRAL VESSELS:
- No evidence of large vessel occlusion or stenosis
- Circle of Willis appears intact

IMPRESSION:
1. Mild generalized cerebral atrophy for age
2. Chronic small vessel ischemic changes in the white matter
3. Mild hydrocephalus ex vacuo (ventricular enlargement due to brain tissue loss)
4. No evidence of acute intracranial pathology, mass lesions, or demyelinating disease
5. Findings are consistent with age-related changes and chronic small vessel disease
6. Recommend neurology consultation for cognitive evaluation
