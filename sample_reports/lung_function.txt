PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS

CLINICAL HISTORY: 68-year-old male with 40-pack-year smoking history. Complains of chronic cough, shortness of breath, and wheezing. Suspected COPD.

TECHNIQUE: Spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusing capacity measurements performed.

SPIROMETRY RESULTS:

PRE-BRONCHODILATOR:
- FVC: 3.2 L (75% predicted) - MILD REDUCTION
- FEV1: 1.8 L (52% predicted) - MODERATE REDUCTION
- FEV1/FVC: 56% (Normal: >70%) - ABNORMAL
- PEF: 4.2 L/sec (60% predicted) - MODERATE REDUCTION

POST-BRONCHODILATOR:
- FVC: 3.4 L (80% predicted) - MILD REDUCTION
- FEV1: 2.0 L (58% predicted) - MODERATE REDUCTION
- FEV1/FVC: 59% (Normal: >70%) - ABNORMAL
- Bronchodilator Response: 11% improvement in FEV1

LUNG VOLUMES:
- TLC: 6.8 L (110% predicted) - MILD INCREASE
- RV: 3.2 L (150% predicted) - SIGNIFICANT INCREASE
- FRC: 4.5 L (125% predicted) - MILD INCREASE
- IC: 2.3 L (65% predicted) - MODERATE REDUCTION

DIFFUSING CAPACITY:
- DLCO: 12.5 mL/min/mmHg (45% predicted) - MODERATE REDUCTION
- DLCO/VA: 2.8 mL/min/mmHg/L (55% predicted) - MILD REDUCTION

ARTERIAL BLOOD GAS (Room Air):
- pH: 7.38 (Normal: 7.35-7.45)
- pCO2: 45 mmHg (Normal: 35-45) - MILD ELEVATION
- pO2: 68 mmHg (Normal: 80-100) - MILD HYPOXIA
- HCO3: 26 mEq/L (Normal: 22-26)
- O2 Saturation: 92% (Normal: >95%) - MILD HYPOXIA

IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate COPD (GOLD Stage 2) with airflow obstruction
2. Mild bronchodilator response (11% improvement in FEV1)
3. Air trapping with increased residual volume
4. Moderate reduction in diffusing capacity
5. Mild hypoxemia and hypercapnia
6. Recommend smoking cessation counseling
7. Consider bronchodilator therapy (long-acting beta-agonist and anticholinergic)
8. Pulmonary rehabilitation program
9. Annual influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations
